# Adjustable-Blur Face Program - A Mini Project

## Description
This Python program uses **OpenCV** to detect faces in real-time through a webcam feed and applies a **blur effect** to the detected faces. 
The program allows for dynamic adjustment of the blur intensity, making it customizable for different use cases. 

It detects frontal faces using a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier.

## Features
- Real-time **frontal face detection** through webcam.
- Adjustable blur intensity using a trackbar.
- Simple interface for modifying blur level.
- Applies a blur effect to detected faces
  
## Requirements
- Python 3.13.1
- OpenCV
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
